# seniorlycodechallenge

Checkout both this repo and the seniorlycodechallenegeserver

I made changes to the server so I could hack together a quick solution, can discuss what I would rather do in a production-ready implementation.

npm start in the seniorlycodechallenge server directory will start the server (make sure to add the twitter creds)

npm start in the directory where this repo is checked out will start this app.

Navigate to http://localhost:3001/ to see the UI
